patch.description=\
Apply a patch to the server or rollback a patch that has been applied.\n\
\n\
This command does not require a connection to the server. If it is connected, \
it will patch the server's installation. If it is not connected, it will patch \
the server installation the command line interface belongs to.\n\
\n\
Applying and rolling back a patch will run consistency checks for all modified items. \
In case file conflicts are detected the operation will fail and the conflicting \
items will be part of the 'failure-description' grouped by type (bundles, modules, misc). \
In order to resolve the conflicts the operation has to be invoked again with \
additional arguments describing how the patch tool should deal with those conflicts.

patch.option.help.description=\
To display command help.

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.bundle-path.description=\
Is allowed only when not connected to the controller (disconnected mode), \
specifies the path to the bundles directory of the target distribution. If the \
argument is not present, the target bundles directory is assumed to be 'bundles' \
directory under the target distribution root directory.

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.bundle-path.value=bundle-dir[{separator}bundle-dir]

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.host.description=\
May appear only in the domain mode and is not allowed in the standalone mode or \
if the cli is disconnected. The argument expects the name of the host of the \
installation to patch.

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.host.value=host name

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.distribution.description=\
is allowed only when not connected to the controller (disconnected mode), specifies \
the target path to the target server distribution. Alternatively, the target distribution \
can be specified using JBOSS_HOME environment variable or jboss.home.dir system property.

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.distribution.value=target-distribution

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.module-path.description=\
is allowed only when not connected to the controller (disconnected mode), \
specifies a list of path (separated by platform specific file sperator) to \
modules directories of the target distribution. If the argument is not present, \
the target modules directory is assumed to be 'modules' directory under the target \
distribution root directory.

patch.abstract-distribution-cmd.option.module-path.value=modules-dir[{separator}modules-dir]

patch.abstract-override-cmd.option.override-all.description=\
The argument does not expect any value and is optional. The default is 'false'. \
It signifies to bypass any content verification on the miscellaneous items \
changed by the patch.

patch.abstract-override-cmd.option.override-modules.description=\
The argument does not expect any value and is optional. The default is 'false'.
It signifies to bypass any content verification on the modules and OSGi bundles \
affected by the patch.

patch.abstract-override-cmd.option.override.description=\
The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous items in the patch that \
can be overridden on the server whether the item reports a conflict or not. \
NOTE: In non-interactive mode this list must be surrounded by square brackets, \
e.g. [item1,item2].

patch.abstract-override-cmd.option.override.value=path(,path)*

patch.abstract-override-cmd.option.preserve.description=\
The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous items that must be \
preserved and not modified by applying or rolling back a patch. NOTE: In \
non-interactive mode this list must be surrounded by square brackets, e.g. \
[item1,item2].

patch.abstract-override-cmd.option.preserve.value=path(,path)*

patch.apply.description=\

Optional argument which specifies the patch stream the patch-id belongs to. \
If the argument is not present, the default patch stream is assumed (the one \
specified in org.jboss.as.product module)

patch.info.description=\
Without additional arguments displays brief information about the installed patches. \
In case the patch ID is specified, displays the information about that specific patch.

patch.info.option.patch-stream.description=\
${patch.history.option.patch-stream.description}

patch.info.option.patch-stream.value=${patch.history.option.patch-stream.value}

patch.info.arguments.description=\
Optional argument, if present the information about this specific patch will be displayed.

patch.info.arguments.value=id

patch.info.option.verbose.description=\
Optional, short version is -v. If present, the information displayed will also \
include details of the layer/add-on patches included in the patch.

patch.info.option.streams.description=\
Optional, will print patch stream names of the patches applied to the installation.

patch.inspect.description=\
Fetches key information (patch id, patch type, target identity name and version, \
description) from the patch.xml of the specified patch file.

patch.inspect.arguments.description=\
The path to the patch to inspect. The path can be either absolute or relative \
to the current directory.

patch.inspect.arguments.value=file path

patch.inspect.option.verbose.description=\
${patch.info.option.verbose.description}

patch.rollback.description=\
Rollback a patch that has been applied

patch.rollback.option.reset-configuration.description=\
The argument is required for the rollback action and expects a boolean value. \
