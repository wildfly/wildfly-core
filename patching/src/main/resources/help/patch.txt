      [--preserve=path(,path)*]
      [--host=<host>]
      [--distribution=<target-distribution>]
      [--module-path=<modules-dir>]
      [--bundle-path=<bundles-dir>]

    <file_path>          - the path to the patch to apply.
                           The path can be either absolute or relative to the
                           current directory.

ACTION: rollback

    Rollback a patch that has been applied

    patch rollback  --reset-configuration=(true|false)
      [--patch-id=<id>]
      [--patch-stream=<patch-stream-name>]
      [--rollback-to]
      [--override-all]
      [--override-modules]
      [--override=path(,path)*]
      [--preserve=path(,path)*]
      [--host=<host>]
      [--distribution=<target-distribution>]
      [--module-path=<modules-dir>]
      [--bundle-path=<bundles-dir>]

    --patch-id=<id>      - the ID of the patch to rollback; for backward
                           compatibility.

    --reset-configuration  - The argument is required for the rollback action
                             and expects a boolean value.
                           It signifies whether the rollback operation should
                           reset the installation configurations to their state
                           before the patch was applied.

    --rollback-to        - The argument does not expect any value and is
                           optional. The default is 'false'.
                           If the patch to rollback is a one-off patch, it
                           signifies that the rollback operation will also
                           rollback all the other one-off patches that have
                           been applied on top of the patch to rollback.

DESCRIPTION

    Apply a patch to the server or rollback a patch that has been applied.

    This command does not require a connection to the server.
    If it is connected, it will patch the server's installation.
    If it is not connected, it will patch the server installation
    the command line interface belongs to.

    Applying and rolling back a patch will run consistency checks for all
    modified items. In case file conflicts are detected the operation will fail
    and the conflicting items will be part of the 'failure-description' grouped
    by type (bundles, modules, misc). In order to resolve the conflicts the
    operation has to be invoked again with additional arguments describing how
    the patch tool should deal with those conflicts.

ARGUMENTS:

 --host=<host>       - may appear only in the domain mode and is not allowed
                       in the standalone mode or if the cli is disconnected.
                       The argument expects the name of the host of the
                       installation to patch.

 --patch-stream      - Optional argument which specifies the patch stream
                       the patch-id belongs to. If the argument is not
                       present, the default patch stream is assumed
                       (the one specified in org.jboss.as.product module)

 --override          - The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous
                       items in the patch that can be overridden on the server
                       whether the item reports a conflict or not. NOTE: In
                       non-interactive mode this list must be surrounded by square
                       brackets, e.g. [item1,item2].

 --preserve          - The value is a comma-separated list of the miscellaneous
                       items that must be preserved and not modified by
                       applying or rolling back a patch. NOTE: In
                       non-interactive mode this list must be surrounded by square
                       brackets, e.g. [item1,item2].

 --override-all      - The argument does not expect any value and is
                       optional. The default is 'false'.
                       It signifies to bypass any content verification on the
                       miscellaneous items changed by the patch.

 --override-modules  - The argument does not expect any value and is
                       optional. The default is 'false'.
                       It signifies to bypass any content verification on the
                       modules and OSGi bundles affected by the patch.

 --distribution      - is allowed only when not connected to the controller
                       (disconnected mode), specifies the target path to
                       the target server distribution. Alternatively,
                       the target distribution can be specified using
                       JBOSS_HOME environment variable or jboss.home.dir
                       system property.

 --module-path       - is allowed only when not connected to the controller
                       (disconnected mode), specifies the path to the modules
                       directory of the target distribution. If the argument is
                       not present, the target modules directory is assumed
                       to be 'modules' directory under the target distribution
                       root directory.

 --bundle-path       - is allowed only when not connected to the controller
                       (disconnected mode), specifies the path to the bundles
                       directory of the target distribution. If the argument is
                       not present, the target bundles directory is assumed
                       to be 'bundles' directory under the target distribution
                       root directory.
