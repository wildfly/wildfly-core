installer.description=\
  Allows users to update or rollback installations provisioned with jboss-eap-installation-manager tool. The jboss-eap-installation-manager \
  also stores the history of updates, supports update rollback and can generate metadata to replicate the server installation.
\n\
  This command requires a connection to the server. If it is connected, \
it will patch the server's installation. If it is not connected, it will patch \
the server installation the command line interface belongs to.\n\
\n\
Applying and rolling back a patch will run consistency checks for all modified items. \
In case file conflicts are detected the operation will fail and the conflicting \
items will be part of the 'failure-description' grouped by type (bundles, modules, misc). \
In order to resolve the conflicts the operation has to be invoked again with \
additional arguments describing how the patch tool should deal with those conflicts.
