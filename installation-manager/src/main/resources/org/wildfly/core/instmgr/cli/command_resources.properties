installer.description=\
     Updates or revert installations provisioned with the JBoss EAP Installation Manager tool. The command also enables you to view the history \
  of updates and export installation details to replicate the current server candidate in a different machine. To use this command you must be connected to \
  a running server. The command is not available for embedded server and host controllers.\
  \n\
  The purpose of this command is to remotely update or revert installations using the jboss-cli interactive session. If you are updating or reverting a local \
  installation, it is recommended to use the JBoss EAP Installation Manager.


# GENERIC HOST
installer.abstract-inst-mgr-cmd.option.host.description=\
  Name of the host where the channel will be added. This option is required only in the domain mode and is not available in the standalone mode.


# CHANNEL ADD
installer.channel-add.description=\
  Subscribes the installation to a new channel.

installer.channel-add.option.channel-name.description=\
  Name of the new channel to add.

installer.channel-add.option.manifest.description=\
  Location of the channel manifest artifact. A manifest defines the versions and Artifacts that will be available from this channel. Specify the location as a file \
  path, URL or Maven GAV coordinate (groupId:artifactId:version). If the manifest version is not mentioned in the GAV coordinates, the latest available manifest is used.

installer.channel-add.option.repositories.description=\
  A collection of Maven repositories that contains the artifacts associated with the channel. Specify the location of the repositories as URLs or ID::URL pairs. \
  You can also specify multiple repositories separated by commas.


# CHANNEL EDIT
installer.channel-edit.description=\
  Edits the channel subscription.

installer.channel-edit.option.channel-name.description=\
  Name of the new channel to edit.

installer.channel-edit.option.manifest.description=\
  Location of the channel manifest artifact. A manifest defines the versions and Artifacts that will be available from this channel. Specify the location as a file \
  path, URL or Maven GAV coordinate (groupId:artifactId:version). If the manifest version is not mentioned in the GAV coordinates, the latest available manifest is used.

installer.channel-edit.option.repositories.description=\
  A collection of Maven repositories that contains the artifacts associated with the channel. Specify the location of the repositories as URLs or ID::URL pairs. \
  You can also specify multiple repositories separated by commas.


# CHANNEL LIST
installer.channel-list.description=\
  Lists all the channels subscribed by the installation.


# CHANNEL REMOVE
installer.channel-remove.description=\
  Unsubscribes the installation from a channel.

installer.channel-remove.option.channel-name.description=\
  Name of the new channel to remove.


# CLEAN
installer.clean.description=\
  Removes all the custom patches, temporary files, and prepared installations that are ready to be applied. When you run this command without any options, all \
  the prepared and pending installations that are yet to be applied to the server are deleted.

installer.clean.option.custom-patch-manifest.description=\
  Manifest artifact location expressed as GA (GroupId:aritfactId) maven coordinate.


# HISTORY
installer.history.description=\
  Lists all the previous installation states.

installer.history.option.revision.description=\
  Hash of an installation state. The option displays a detailed description about the changes made in that revision.


# REVERT
installer.revert.description=\
  Reverts the server to a previous installation state. The server is reverted in two phases:\
  \n\
  \n\
  Prepare the server candidate: This phase creates a server candidate that is reverted to the requested installation state. The server candidate is prepared on \
  the temporary directory (jboss.domain.temp.dir on domain mode or jboss.server.temp.dir on standalone server mode) of the base server. After this operation is \
  completed, no further preparations can be made. If you want to discard this server candidate, you can use the 'clean' operation.\
  \n\
  \n\
  Apply the server candidate: After the server candidate is prepared, you can apply it to the base server by using the 'shutdown --perform-installation' command. \
  This command will restart the server, apply the server candidate to the base server reverting the base server to the requested previous installation state.\
  \n\
  \n\
  If you are using a local interactive jboss-cli session, the session will be automatically closed. You will need to connect to the local server again. This ensures \
  that the new session uses the most recent changes available on the local installation.

installer.revert.option.repositories.description=\
  Collection of Maven repositories that contains the artifacts required to prepare an installation at the state specified by the 'revision' option. Specify the \
  location of the repositories as URLs or ID::URL pairs. You can also specify multiple repositories separated by commas.

installer.revert.option.local-cache.description=\
  Path to the local Maven repository cache. It overrides the default Maven repository at ~/.m2/repository. The 'path' value represents the location on the file \
  system of the remote machine to which the JBoss CLI is connected.

installer.revert.option.no-resolve-local-cache.description=\
  Perform the operation without resolving or installing artifacts from/into the local maven cache.

installer.revert.option.offline.description=\
  Perform installation from local or file-system Maven repositories only.

installer.revert.option.maven-repo-file.description=\
  The location of the local Maven repository zip File. The file contains the necessary artifacts to prepare the server candidate we want to apply.

installer.revert.option.revision.description=\
  Hash of an installation state of the previous version. The base server will be reverted to this installation state.

installer.revert.option.headers.description=\
  Any operation headers. Depending on the target environment, preparing a server could take time because all the required artifacts need to be downloaded to provision \
  the server candidate. You can use the operation headers to increase the default blocking timeout which is 300 seconds.


# UPDATE
installer.update.description=\
  Updates a server instance with the latest patches.\
  \n\
  \n\
  The complete server update is done in three phases: \
  \n\
  \n\
  List the available updates: Retrieves the list of artifacts that will be updated. If the --dry-run option is not specified, a message asking confirmation to move \
  ahead with the updates of the listed components appears. Listing of the available updates can be \
  skipped by using the --confirm option. The --confirm and --dry-run options cannot be used together. \
  \n\
  \n\
  Prepare the server candidate:  Prepares a server candidate with the latest available patches on the target machine. The server candidate is prepared on a temporary \
  directory (jboss.domain.temp.dir in domain mode or jboss.server.temp.dir in standalone server mode) of the base server. After this operation is complete, no more \
  server preparations can be done. Use the 'clean' command if you want to discard this server candidate, clear the cache of installation manager, and prepare a \
  new server candidate.\
  \n\
  \n\
  Apply the server candidate: After the server candidate is prepared, you can apply it to the base server by using the 'shutdown --perform-installation' command. \
  This command will restart the base server and apply the updates prepared in the previous phase.

installer.update.option.dry-run.description=\
  Executes the command without preparing any server candidate.

installer.update.option.confirm.description=\
 Executes the command and prepares a server candidate without asking confirmation of the available updates.

installer.update.option.repositories.description=\
  A collection of Maven repositories that contains the artifacts required to prepare an installation. Specify the location of the repositories as URLs or ID::URL \
  pairs. You can also specify multiple repositories separated by commas.


installer.update.option.local-cache.description=\
  Path to the local Maven repository cache. It overrides the default Maven repository at ~/.m2/repository. The 'path' value represents the location on the file \
  system of the remote machine to which the JBoss CLI is connected.

installer.update.option.no-resolve-local-cache.description=\
  Perform the operation without resolving or installing artifacts from/into the local maven cache.

installer.update.option.offline.description=\
  Perform installation from local or file-system Maven repositories only.

installer.update.option.headers.description=\
  Any operation headers. Depending on the target environment, preparing a server could take time because all the required artifacts need to be downloaded to provision \
  the server candidate. You can use the operation headers to increase the default blocking timeout which is 300 seconds.


# CUSTOM PATCHES
installer.upload-custom-patch.description=\
  Uploads a custom patch to the base server. It also creates a new channel that will provide this custom patch and subscribes the installation to this channel. \
  After uploading a custom patch if you want to remove it, you can use the clean operation to remove it from the server.

installer.upload-custom-patch.option.custom-patch-file.description=\
  Location of the custom patch file.

installer.upload-custom-patch.option.manifest.description=\
  Location of the channel manifest artifact. A manifest defines the versions and Artifacts that will be available from this channel. Specify the location as a file \
  path, URL or Maven GAV coordinate (groupId:artifactId:version). If the manifest version is not mentioned in the GAV coordinates, the latest available manifest is used.
