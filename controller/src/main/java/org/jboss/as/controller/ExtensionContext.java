     * Registers that the extension <strong>may</strong> provide an {@link ExpressionResolverExtension} if one of its
     * subsystems is appropriately configured. Calling this informs the management kernel that the resolver extension
     * may be installed at some point and provides a supplier via which the resolver extension can be obtained. It also
     * instructs the management kernel as to how to handle expression strings that might be of interest to the
     * resolver extension if it were configured.
     * <p>
     * Once this is invoked, the kernel expression resolver will begin calling the given {@code supplier} whenever it
     * needs to resolve an expression string. If it returns a non-null value, the returned {@link ExpressionResolverExtension}
     * will be invoked to ensure it is {@link ExpressionResolverExtension#initialize(OperationContext) initialized} and
     * to try and {@link ExpressionResolverExtension#resolveExpression(String, OperationContext) resolve the expression string.}
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the given {@code supplier} returns [@code null}, that indicates the resolver extension has not yet been
     * configured (and perhaps never will be.) The management kernel resolver will however continue to account for the
     * resolver extension in the following ways:
     * <ol>
     *     <li>It will check if any unresolved expression string matches the provided {@code expressionPatterns}. If not
     *     no further action is taken with respect to this resolver extension.</li>
     *     <li>If it does match, and the expression resolution is occurring in {@link OperationContext.Stage#MODEL}, an
     *     exception will be thrown. The effect of this is calling this method disables {@code Stage.MODEL} resolution
     *     of expressions that match the pattern. Resolving in Stage.MODEL is generally an anti-pattern though, although
     *     there are cases where it is attempted, particular with {@code system-property} resources.</li>
     *     <li>If it does match and the expression resolution is occurring <strong>after</strong> {@link OperationContext.Stage#MODEL},
     *     the behavior depends on the provided {@code requiresRuntimeResolution} parameter. If {@code true}, an
     *     exception will be thrown, as the required resolution could not be performed. If {@code false}, no
     *     resolution will be attempted and the overall resolution will continue on. Setting this to false allows
     *     expressions that match the pattern but which aren't definitely meant for handling by the resolver extension
     *     to still be processed.</li>
     * </ol>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that if multiple callers register resolver extensions, the management kernel will apply the above logic to
     * each in turn until one provides a resolved string or all have been given an opportunity to try. Only when all
     * have been given an opportunity to try will any exception resulting from one of the attempts be propagated. If none
     * provide a resolved string, but none throw an exception, the expression resolution will move on to trying
     * the core management kernel expression resolution mechanism.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param supplier function to be checked during expression resolution to determine if the resolver extension
     *                 is available. Supplier should return {@code null} if the resolver extension isn't actually configured
     *                 by a subsystem. The supplier itself cannot be {@code null}.
     * @param expressionPattern if the {@code supplier} returns {@code null}, the pattern the kernel expression resolver
     *                          should use to determine if a given expression string would be of interest to the
