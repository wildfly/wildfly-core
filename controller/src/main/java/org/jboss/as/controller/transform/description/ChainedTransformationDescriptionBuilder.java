 * {@link TransformationDescriptionBuilder.Factory#createChainedSubystemInstance(ModelVersion). The {@code ModelVersion} parameter

 * if this is used, all children must also use chained transformers. Typically you should create a chain for the subsystem
 * and add child transformations using the chained builder.
