help.option.commands.description=\
List of available commands. The resulting listing may depend on the current context.\
 E.g. some of the commands require an established connection to the controller \
(standalone or domain). These commands won't appear in the listing unless the \
connection has been established. Other commands may depend on the availability \
of specific subsystems. E.g. if the messaging subsystem is not available, \
messaging-related commands will not be listed.
