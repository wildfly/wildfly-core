DESCRIPTION

   Launches an embedded host controller in the CLI process.

ARGUMENTS

 -c                - Name of the domain configuration file to use
                     (default is "domain.xml")
                     (Same as --domain-config)

 --jboss-home      - Filesystem path pointing to the root directory
                     of the installation from which the embedded host controller
                     should run. Only available if the CLI itself
                     is not running in a modular classloading environment.
                     In a non-modular classloading environment, if this
                     option is not specified, the value of the
                     environment variable JBOSS_HOME will be used.
                     Must be specified if the environment variable
                     JBOSS_HOME is not set. In a modular classloading
                     environment it is assumed the CLI is running from
                     the host controller installation itself and the JBOSS_HOME
                     environment variable must be set.

 --domain-config   - Name of the domain configuration file to use
                     (default is "domain.xml")
                     (Same as -c)

 --host-config     - Name of the host configuration file to use
                     (default is "host.xml")

 --std-out         - How to handle output to System.out from the
                     embedded host controller. Legal values are
                     "discard" and "echo". The "discard" value indicates
                     that writes to System.out from the server
                     should be discarded. The "echo" value means
                     writes should be handled and appear as part
                     of the CLI's own output to System.out. The
                     default value is "discard". If "echo" is
                     chosen and the CLI is running an interactive
                     session, the user should recognize that
                     asynchronous output from the server may
                     interfere with the normal appearance of
                     the CLI prompt.

 --timeout         - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the
                     host controller to reach a running (i.e.
                     fully started) state once the embedded server
                     is created. If unspecified, the command will
                     block for as long as necessary, with no upper
                     limit. If the value is less than 1, the command
                     will return as soon as the embedded server has
                     reached the point in its boot where it is
                     manageable by the CLI.

 --empty-host-config  - Start the embedded host controller with an empty host
                        configuration (host.xml). A host controller may be added
                     using the /host=NewHostControllerName:add() operation.
                     Configuration will be persisted when changes are made.

 --empty-domain-config  - Start the embedded host controller with an empty
                          domain configuration (domain.xml). Configuration
                     changes made will be persisted.

 --remove-existing-host-config  - When --empty-host-config is used, and the
                                  host configuration file already exists, allow
                     the existing file to be removed and replaced with an empty
                     one.

 --remove-existing-domain-config  - When --empty-domain-config is used, and the
                                    domain configuration file already exists,
                     allow the existing domain configuration file to be removed
                     and replace with an empty one. [May only be used in
                     conjunction with --empty-domain-config.]
