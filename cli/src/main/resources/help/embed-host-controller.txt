SYNOPSIS

   embed-host-controller [-c=config_file || --domain-config=domain_config_file]
                         [--host-config=host_config_file]
                         [--jboss-home=rootdir] [--stdout=discard|echo]

DESCRIPTION

   Launches an embedded host controller in the CLI process.

ARGUMENTS

 -c                - Name of the domain configuration file to use (default is
                     "domain.xml")
                     (Same as --domain-config)

 --jboss-home      - Filesystem path pointing to the root directory of the
                     installation from which the embedded host controller
                     should run. Only available if the CLI itself is not
                     running in a modular classloading environment. In a
                     non-modular classloading environment, if this option is
                     not specified, the value of the environment variable
                     JBOSS_HOME will be used. Must be specified if the
                     environment variable JBOSS_HOME is not set. In a modular
                     classloading environment it is assumed the CLI is running
                     from the host controller installation itself and the
                     JBOSS_HOME environment variable must be set.

 --domain-config   - Name of the domain configuration file to use (default is
                     "domain.xml")
                     (Same as -c)

 --host-config     - Name of the host configuration file to use (default is
                     "host.xml")

 --std-out         - How to handle output to System.out from the embedded host
                     controller. Legal values are "discard" and "echo". The
                     "discard" value indicates that writes to System.out from
                     the server should be discarded. The "echo" value means
                     writes should be handled and appear as part of the CLI's
                     own output to System.out. The default value is "discard".
                     If "echo" is chosen and the CLI is running an interactive
                     session, the user should recognize that asynchronous
                     output from the server may interfere with the normal
                     appearance of the CLI prompt.

 --timeout         - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the host controller
                     to reach a running (i.e. fully started) state once the
                     embedded server is created. If unspecified, the command
                     will block for as long as necessary, with no upper limit.
                     If the value is less than 1, the command will return as
                     soon as the embedded server has reached the point in its
                     boot where it is manageable by the CLI.

 --empty-host-config  - Start the embedded host controller with an empty host
                        configuration (host.xml). The hostname will be
                     automatically derived from the current hostname.
                     Configuration will be persisted when configuration changes
                     are made. [See --temp-host-controller-name below for
                     details on how to start an embedded host controller with a
                     temporary name.]

 --empty-domain-config  - Start the embedded host controller with an empty
                          domain configuration (domain.xml). Configuration
                     changes made will be persisted.

 --temp-host-controller-name  - Start the host controller with the provided
                                name. [May only be used in conjunction with
                     --empty-host-config]

 --remove-existing-host-config  - When --empty-host-config is used, and the
                                  host configuration file already exists, allow
                     the existing file to be removed and replaced with an empty
                     one. [May only be used in conjunction with
                     --empty-host-config.]

 --remove-existing-domain-config  - When --empty-domain-config is used, and the
                                    domain configuration file already exists,
                     allow the existing domain configuration file to be removed
                     and replace with an empty one. [May only be used in
                     conjunction with --empty-domain-config.]
