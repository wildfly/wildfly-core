Operation requests start with './' or '/' and follow the format:

[node-type=node-name (/node-type=node-name)*] : operation-name ['('[name=value [, name=value]*]')'] [{header (;header)*}]

e.g. /subsystem=undertow/listener=http:read-attribute(name=enabled)

If the operation request doesn't require a node path then the request can start
with ':' followed by an operation name and the property list if necessary ('/:'
and './:' are also possible).

Whitespaces between the separators are insignificant.
If the operation doesn't require arguments then the brackets '()' are optional.
Tab-completion for operation requests supports node types and names, operation
names, property names and, in some cases, values.
