SYNOPSIS

   embed-server [--jboss-home=rootdir]
                [--stdout=discard|echo]

DESCRIPTION

   Launches a standalone server embedded in the CLI process.
   Only available if the CLI process is running in a modular
   classloading environment with a module loader able to
   load all necessary server modules.

ARGUMENTS

 --jboss-home      - Filesystem path pointing to the root directory
                     of the installation from which the CLI is
                     running and from which the embedded server
                     should run. If not specified, the value of the
                     environment variable JBOSS_HOME will be used.
                     Must be specified if the environment variable
                     JBOSS_HOME is not set.

 --std-out         - How to handle output to System.out from the
                     embedded server. Legal values are "discard"
                     and "echo". The "discard" value indicates
                     that writes to System.out from the server
                     should be discarded. The "echo" value means
                     writes should be handled and appear as part
                     of the CLI's own output to System.out. The
                     default value is "discard". If "echo" is
                     chosen and the CLI is running an interactive
                     session, the user should recognize that
                     asynchronous output from the server may
                     interfere with the normal appearance of
                     the CLI prompt.
