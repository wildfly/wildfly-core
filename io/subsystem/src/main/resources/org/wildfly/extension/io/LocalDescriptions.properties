io=IO subsystem
io.add=Operation Adds subsystem
io.remove=Operation Removes subsystem
io.worker=Defines workers
io.worker.add=Adds new worker
io.worker.remove=Removes worker
io.worker.task-max-threads=Specify the maximum number of threads for the worker task thread pool.\
  If not set, default value used which is calculated by formula cpuCount * 16,\
  as long as MaxFileDescriptorCount jmx property allows that number, otherwise calculation takes max into account to adjust it accordingly.
io.worker.stack-size=The stack size (in bytes) to attempt to use for worker threads.
io.worker.io-threads=Specify the number of I/O threads to create for the worker.  \
  If not specified, a default will be chosen, which is calculated by cpuCount * 2
io.worker.task-keepalive=Specify the number of milliseconds to keep non-core task threads alive.
io.buffer-pool=Defines buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.add=Adds new buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.remove=Removes buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.buffers-per-slice=Maximum number of buffers
io.buffer-pool.buffer-size=Total size of the buffer handled by the subsystem
io.buffer-pool.direct-buffers=Indicate if the buffer is a direct buffer or not (see Java NIO documentation)
io.worker.core-pool-size=Minimum number of threads to keep in the underlying java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor even if they are idle. Threads over this limit will be terminated over time specified by task-keepalive attribute.
io.worker.max-pool-size=The maximum number of threads to allow in the thread pool. Depending on implementation, when this limit is reached, tasks which cannot be queued may be rejected.
io.worker.shutdown-requested=True is shutdown of the pool was requested
io.worker.queue-size=An estimate of the number of tasks in the worker queue.
io.worker.io-thread-count=I/O thread count
io.worker.busy-task-thread-count=An estimate of busy threads in the task worker thread pool
io.worker.server=Runtime resource that describes listening servers utilizing this worker
io.worker.outbound-bind-address=Defines bind addresses to use when connecting to specified destinations
io.worker.server.connection-count=Estimate of the current connection count
io.worker.server.connection-limit-low-water-mark=If the connection count has previously hit the high water mark, once it drops back down below this count, connections will be accepted again.
io.worker.server.connection-limit-high-water-mark=If the connection count hits this number, no new connections will be accepted until the count drops below the low-water mark.
io.outbound-bind-address=Defines a bind address to use when connecting to the specified destination
io.outbound-bind-address.add=Add a new bind address configuration
io.outbound-bind-address.remove=Remove a bind address configuration
io.outbound-bind-address.match=The destination address range to match
io.outbound-bind-address.bind-address=The address to bind to when the destination address matches
io.outbound-bind-address.bind-port=The port number to bind to when the destination address matches
