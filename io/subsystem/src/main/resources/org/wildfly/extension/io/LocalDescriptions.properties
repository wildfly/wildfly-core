io=IO subsystem
io.add=Operation Adds subsystem
io.remove=Operation Removes subsystem
io.worker=Defines workers
io.worker.add=Adds new worker
io.worker.remove=Removes worker
io.worker.task-max-threads=Specify the maximum number of threads for the worker task thread pool.\
  If not set, default value used which is calculated by formula cpuCount * 16,\
  as long as MaxFileDescriptorCount jmx property allows that number, otherwise calculation takes max into account to adjust it accordingly.
io.worker.stack-size=The stack size (in bytes) to attempt to use for worker threads.
io.worker.io-threads=Specify the number of I/O threads to create for the worker.  \
  If not specified, a default will be chosen, which is calculated by cpuCount * 2
io.worker.task-keepalive=Specify the number of milliseconds to keep non-core task threads alive.
io.buffer-pool=Defines buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.add=Adds new buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.remove=Removes buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.buffers-per-slice=How many buffers per slice, if not set optimal value is calculated based on available RAM resources in your system.
io.buffer-pool.buffer-size=The size of each buffer slice in bytes, if not set optimal value is calculated based on available RAM resources in your system.
io.buffer-pool.direct-buffers=Does the buffer pool use direct buffers, some platforms don't support direct buffers
io.worker.core-pool-size=Core worker thread pool size
io.worker.max-pool-size=Max worker pool size
io.worker.shutdown-requested=True is shutdown of the pool was requested
io.worker.queue-size=An estimate of the number of tasks in the worker queue.
io.worker.io-thread-count=I/O thread count
io.worker.server=Runtime resource that describes listening servers utilizing this worker
io.worker.outbound-bind-address=Defines bind addresses to use when connecting to specified destinations
io.outbound-bind-address=Defines a bind address to use when connecting to the specified destination
io.outbound-bind-address.add=Add a new bind address configuration
io.outbound-bind-address.remove=Remove a bind address configuration
io.outbound-bind-address.match=The destination address range to match
io.outbound-bind-address.bind-address=The address to bind to when the destination address matches
io.outbound-bind-address.bind-port=The port number to bind to when the destination address matches
