io=IO subsystem
io.add=Operation Adds subsystem
io.remove=Operation Removes subsystem
io.default-worker=Specifies the default I/O worker
io.worker=Defines workers
io.worker.add=Adds new worker
io.worker.remove=Removes worker
io.worker.task-core-threads=Specify the starting number of threads for the worker task thread pool.
io.worker.task-max-threads=Specify the maximum number of threads for the worker task thread pool.\
  If not set, a default value used which is calculated by the formula cpuCount * 16,\
  as long as the MaxFileDescriptorCount jmx property allows that number; otherwise the calculation takes that max into account and adjusts accordingly.
io.worker.stack-size=The stack size (in bytes) to attempt to use for worker threads.
io.worker.io-threads=Specify the number of I/O threads to create for the worker.  \
  If not specified, a default will be chosen, which is calculated by cpuCount * 2
io.worker.task-keepalive=Specify the number of milliseconds to keep non-core task threads alive.
io.buffer-pool=Defines buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.add=Adds new buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.remove=Removes buffer pool
io.buffer-pool.buffers-per-slice=How many buffers per slice, if not set optimal value is calculated based on available RAM resources in your system.
io.buffer-pool.buffer-size=The size of each buffer slice in bytes, if not set optimal value is calculated based on available RAM resources in your system.
io.buffer-pool.direct-buffers=Does the buffer pool use direct buffers, some platforms don't support direct buffers
io.buffer-pool.deprecated=This has been replaced by the buffer pool in the Undertow subsystem
io.worker.core-pool-size=Minimum number of threads to keep in the underlying thread pool even if they are idle. Threads over this limit will be terminated over time specified by task-keepalive attribute.
io.worker.max-pool-size=The maximum number of threads allowed in the worker task thread pool. Depending on the pool implementation, when this limit is reached tasks which cannot be queued may be rejected. This can be configured using the 'task-max-threads' attribute; see the description of that attribute for details on how this value is determined.
io.worker.shutdown-requested=True is shutdown of the pool was requested
io.worker.queue-size=An estimate of the number of tasks in the worker queue.
io.worker.io-thread-count=I/O thread count
io.worker.busy-task-thread-count=An estimate of busy threads in the task worker thread pool
io.worker.server=Runtime resource that describes listening servers utilizing this worker
io.worker.outbound-bind-address=Defines bind addresses to use when connecting to specified destinations
io.worker.server.connection-count=Estimate of the current connection count
io.worker.server.connection-limit-low-water-mark=If the connection count has previously hit the high water mark, once it drops back down below this count, connections will be accepted again.
io.worker.server.connection-limit-high-water-mark=If the connection count hits this number, no new connections will be accepted until the count drops below the low-water mark.
io.outbound-bind-address=Defines a bind address to use when connecting to the specified destination
io.outbound-bind-address.add=Add a new bind address configuration
io.outbound-bind-address.remove=Remove a bind address configuration
io.outbound-bind-address.match=The destination address range to match
io.outbound-bind-address.bind-address=The address to bind to when the destination address matches
io.outbound-bind-address.bind-port=The port number to bind to when the destination address matches
