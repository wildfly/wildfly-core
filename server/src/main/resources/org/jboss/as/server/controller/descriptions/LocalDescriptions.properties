A value smaller than zero means that the server will wait indefinitely for all active requests to finish.
server.stop.timeout=If this timeout is set a graceful shutdown will be attempted. If this is zero (the default) then the server will shutdown immediately. A value larger than zero means the server will wait up to this many seconds for all active requests to finish. A value smaller than zero means that the server will wait indefinitely for all active requests to finish.
server.stop.timeout.deprecated=Use suspend-timeout instead.

server.shutdown.restart=If true, once shutdown the server will be restarted again
server.shutdown.suspend-timeout=The graceful shutdown timeout in seconds. If this is zero (the default) then the server will shutdown immediately.

server.shutdown.timeout.deprecated=Use suspend-timeout instead.
server.suspend=Suspends server operations gracefully. All current requests will complete normally, however no new requests will be accepted.
server.suspend.suspend-timeout=The suspend operation timeout in seconds. If this is zero (the default) the operation will return immediately. A value larger than zero means the operation will wait up to this many seconds to complete before returning. A value smaller than zero means that the operation will wait indefinitely for all active requests to finish. Note that the operation will not roll back if the timeout is exceeded, it just means that not all current requests completed in the specified timeout.
server.suspend.timeout=The timeout that a suspend operation will wait for the suspend operation to complete before returning. If this is zero the operation will return immediately, -1 means that it will wait indefinitely. Note that the operation will not roll back if the timeout is exceeded, it just means that not all current requests completed in the specified timeout.
server.suspend.timeout.deprecated=Use suspend-timeout instead.
server.resume=Resumes normal operations on a suspended server.

deployment.full-replace-deployment=Add previously uploaded deployment content to the list of content available for use, replace existing content of the same name in the runtime, and remove the replaced content from the list of content available for use. This is equivalent to an 'add', 'undeploy', 'deploy', 'remove' sequence where the new content has the same name as the content being replaced. Precisely one of 'runtime-name', 'hash', 'input-stream-index', 'bytes' or 'url' must be specified.
deployment.full-replace-deployment.content=List of pieces of content that comprise the deployment.
deployment.full-replace-deployment.enabled=Boolean indicating whether the replacement deployment content should be deployed in the runtime (or should be deployed in the runtime the next time the server starts.) An undefined value indicates the state of the existing deployment should be retained.
deployment.full-replace-deployment.name=Unique identifier of the deployment. Must be unique across all deployments.
