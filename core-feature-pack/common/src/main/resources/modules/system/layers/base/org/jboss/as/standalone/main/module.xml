             These are loaded by the JAXP redirect facility in jboss-modules when this module is used
             as a boot module. The purpose is to provide a common default JAXP implementation on all
             JDKs. This is necessary since we have to override the JAXP APIs to fix incompatibilities
             with modular class-loading. In the future we may be able to replace this construct if
             JAXP APIs are fixed on all known JVMs *and* we implement a subsystem to provide a similar
             default/fallback common parser behavior. Please discuss any design changes in this area
             on the WildFly development mailing list before enacting.

             Xalan is optional for deritives of wildfly-core that do not desire TransformerFactory
             support, or wish to require that deployments bundle an xslt implementaiton to use it,
             as it will break otherwise.
